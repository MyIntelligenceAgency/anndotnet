!ML Configuration file for Predict Future Daily Sales for 10 Items
! This examples is modified version of Example Predict Future Sales
! Data set is extracted only 10 items and create training and test data sets

!features represent itemID encoded as one-hot-vector (first 10 values) and then 30 days of sales in past
!In total features consist of 40 predictors (10 + 30) 
features:|Item 10 0 |Sale 30 0

!daily product sales contains only daily sales for the specified item
!labels is defined with dynamic axes since the model is created with LSTM which uses dynamic axes for recurrence
labels:|item_cnt 1 0

!training process is defined with 200 iteration, but it can be more. ALso the normalization is enabled as separate network layer, since during data transformation no normalization has been performed.
